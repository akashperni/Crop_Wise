# CropWise ðŸŒ¿

CropWise is an AI-powered application designed to recommend the most suitable crops to grow on a farm based on various input parameters. This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide precise and accurate crop recommendations, thus aiding precision agriculture.

## Features

- **Crop Recommendation**: Predicts the best crop to grow based on soil and weather parameters.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained GaussianNB model to make predictions.

## How It Works

1. **User Inputs**: Users input the values for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall.
2. **Model Prediction**: The model predicts the most suitable crop based on the provided inputs.
3. **Results**: Displays the recommended crop to the user.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
